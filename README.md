# CustomerSegmentation

This repository is dedicated to helping a company segment its customers to better understand their behaviors and preferences. Customer segmentation allows the company to tailor marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance product offerings. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms such as K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering to create meaningful customer segments based on features like age, income, and spending score.

Key features:

Implementation of K-Means clustering with varying cluster sizes.
Application of Agglomerative Clustering for comparison.
Use of Silhouette Score to evaluate clustering performance and determine the optimal number of clusters.
Data visualization for better interpretability of the clusters.
